      aboutText: `Hi, I'm Ayaan, a software/AI engineer and founder with a passion for building products that make life easier and more insightful.
I studied Computer Engineering at UIUC, worked as a federal contractor in DC, and later joined a biotech startup developing deep learning models for early cancer detection. Now, I'm pursuing my Master's in AI at Northwestern, refining my expertise in machine learning, automation, and product design.
I'm fascinated by how AI can enhance everyday experiences. This led me to create dytto, an AI-driven journaling app that seamlessly captures and analyzes daily lifeâ€”solving the problem of journaling being too much effort while creating a memory bank that lasts forever.

        fullDescription: `As a Full Stack Developer and Machine Learning Engineer, I bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and practical software applications. My journey began with a solid foundation in Computer Engineering at UIUC, where I developed a strong understanding of both hardware and software systems.

My professional experience spans from federal contracting work in Washington DC to biotech innovation, where I applied deep learning techniques to solve critical healthcare challenges. This diverse background has given me a unique perspective on how technology can be leveraged across different domains.

Currently pursuing advanced studies in Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern University, I'm deepening my expertise in neural networks, computer vision, and natural language processing. My goal is to create intelligent systems that not only process data efficiently but also provide meaningful insights and enhance human experiences.

The culmination of my passion and expertise is dytto, an AI-powered journaling application I founded that transforms how people capture and reflect on their daily experiences. By automating the collection of contextual data and generating personalized narratives, dytto makes journaling effortless while creating a rich, searchable memory bank that grows more valuable over time.`,
